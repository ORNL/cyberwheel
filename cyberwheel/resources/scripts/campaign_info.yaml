  description: 'Adversaries may send spearphishing emails with a malicious attachment
    in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing attachment is a
    specific variant of spearphishing. Spearphishing attachment is different from
    other forms of spearphishing in that it employs the use of malware attached to
    an email. All forms of spearphishing are electronically delivered social engineering
    targeted at a specific individual, company, or industry. In this scenario, adversaries
    attach a file to the spearphishing email and usually rely upon [User Execution](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1204)
    to gain execution. Spearphishing may also involve social engineering techniques,
    such as posing as a trusted source.


    There are many options for the attachment such as Microsoft Office documents,
    executables, PDFs, or archived files. Upon opening the attachment (and potentially
    clicking past protections), the adversary''s payload exploits a vulnerability
    or directly executes on the user''s system. The text of the spearphishing email
    usually tries to give a plausible reason why the file should be opened, and may
    explain how to bypass system protections in order to do so. The email may also
    contain instructions on how to decrypt an attachment, such as a zip file password,
    in order to evade email boundary defenses. Adversaries frequently manipulate file
    extensions and icons in order to make attached executables appear to be document
    files, or files exploiting one application appear to be a file for a different
    one. '

    \ in an attempt to gain access to victim systems. Spearphishing via service is\
    \ a specific variant of spearphishing. It is different from other forms of spearphishing\
    \ in that it employs the use of third party services rather than directly via\
    \ enterprise email channels. \n\nAll forms of spearphishing are electronically\
    \ delivered social engineering targeted at a specific individual, company, or\
    \ industry. In this scenario, adversaries send messages through various social\
    \ media services, personal webmail, and other non-enterprise controlled services.\
    \ These services are more likely to have a less-strict security policy than an\
    \ enterprise. As with most kinds of spearphishing, the goal is to generate rapport\
    \ with the target or get the target's interest in some way. Adversaries will create\
    \ fake social media accounts and message employees for potential job opportunities.\
    \ Doing so allows a plausible reason for asking about services, policies, and\
    \ software that's running in an environment. The adversary can then send malicious\
    \ links or attachments through these services.\n\nA common example is to build\
    \ rapport with a target via social media, then send content to a personal webmail\
    \ service that the target uses on their work computer. This allows an adversary\
    \ to bypass some email restrictions on the work account, and the target is more\
    \ likely to open the file since it's something they were expecting. If the payload\
    \ doesn't work as expected, the adversary can continue normal communications and\
    \ troubleshoot with the target on how to get it working."

  description: 'Adversaries may use an existing, legitimate external Web service as
    a means for relaying data to/from a compromised system. Popular websites and social
    media acting as a mechanism for C2 may give a significant amount of cover due
    to the likelihood that hosts within a network are already communicating with them
    prior to a compromise. Using common services, such as those offered by Google
    or Twitter, makes it easier for adversaries to hide in expected noise. Web service
    providers commonly use SSL/TLS encryption, giving adversaries an added level of
    protection.


    Use of Web services may also protect back-end C2 infrastructure from discovery
    through malware binary analysis while also enabling operational resiliency (since
    this infrastructure may be dynamically changed).'
